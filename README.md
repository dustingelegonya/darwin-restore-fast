# The Lion's Paw Reanimation and Reconfiguration System for Darwin (MacOs Monteray or higher)
> Designed for both Intel and Silcon based Darwin Macintosh systems affected by catastrophic disk failures or equally devestating events that warrent a full system resinstallation and reconfigureation.


## READY TO ROCK AN ROLL? [Start Here](https://github.com/jellylabs-ltd/the-lions-paw-reanimation-and-reconfiguration-system-for-darwin/blob/main/phase-one.md) otherwise you may read-on.


## Project Overview
A comprehensive disaster recovery system designed to rapidly restore Intel and Silcon based Darwin Macintosh systems to operational status following unrecoverable failures or catastrophic events. This project was inteded to ensure that no single point of failure can permanently disrupt your development or production workflow, well for to long anyways. By maintaining comprehensive, automated, and tested recovery procedures, you can confidently face any catastrophic event knowing your personal or work (dev/prod/staging) machine's environment can be fully restored quickly and reliably with minimal downtime.



## Core Objectives
- **Rapid-Phased-Systematic recovery approach**: Minimize downtime from hours/days to minutes
- **Complete Environment Restoration**: Recreate entire development ecosystem
- **Automated Deployment**: Reduce manual intervention and human error
- **Version Control Integration**: Sync with current project states

## Architecture Components

### 1. Configuration Management
**Infrastructure as Code approach for machine setup**

#### Dotfiles Repository
- Shell configurations (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, `.fish`)
- Editor configs (VS Code, Vim, Emacs settings)
- Git configuration and SSH keys
- Application preferences and themes (dark theme priority)
- Terminal emulator settings

#### Package Management
- Homebrew
- Nix
- Npm

### 2. Development Environment Snapshots
**Complete development stack preservation**

#### Runtime Environments
- Node.js/npm global packages and versions
- Python virtual environments and requirements
- Ruby gems and bundler configs
- Docker images and containers
- Database schemas and test data

#### IDE and Editor State
- Extension lists and configurations
- Workspace settings and layouts
- Code snippets and templates
- Debugging configurations
- Plugin preferences

### 3. Data Backup Strategy
**Critical data preservation and sync**

#### Code Repositories
- Automated git repository discovery and backup
- Branch state preservation
- Uncommitted changes capture
- Submodule configurations

#### Project Files
- Active project directories
- Documentation and notes
- Configuration files
- Local databases and datasets

### 4. Automation Scripts
**Deployment and restoration automation**

#### Bootstrap Scripts:
```
# -- COMMING SOON -- (FEATURE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
# Quick start recovery script ->
# Uncomment the bash at the end. `bootstrap.sh | bash` to activate this one-line installer.
## curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jellylabs-ltd/lions-paw-reanimation-system-for-darwin/main/bootstrap.sh | #bash
```

### 5. Cloud Integration
**Remote storage and synchronization**

#### Storage Backends
- GitHub/GitLab for version-controlled configs
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox) for large files
- Database backups in cloud databases
- Container registry for custom Docker images

#### Sync Mechanisms
- Real-time file synchronization
- Scheduled backup jobs
- Delta sync for large files
- Conflict resolution strategies

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Configuration Capture
- Audit current development machine setup
- Create comprehensive dotfiles repository
- Document package dependencies and versions
- Establish baseline configuration

### Phase 2: Automation Development
- Build cross-platform bootstrap scripts
- Create package installation automation
- Develop configuration deployment system
- Test recovery process on clean machines

### Phase 3: Data Backup Integration
- Implement automated code repository backup
- Set up project file synchronization
- Create database backup procedures
- Establish cloud storage workflows

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Maintenance
- Create health check systems
- Set up automated backup scheduling
- Implement change detection and alerts
- Establish recovery testing procedures

## Recovery Workflow

### Emergency Recovery Steps
1. **Bootstrap Installation**: Run single command to start recovery
2. **System Setup**: Install OS packages and development tools
3. **Configuration Restoration**: Apply dotfiles and preferences
4. **Data Recovery**: Sync repositories and project files
5. **Environment Validation**: Verify all systems operational
6. **Project Resumption**: Continue work with minimal interruption

### Time Targets
- **Basic System**: 15-30 minutes
- **Full Development Environment**: 45-60 minutes
- **Complete Project State**: 60-90 minutes

## Technology Stack Recommendations

### Configuration Management
- **Ansible**: Infrastructure automation and configuration
- **Chezmoi**: Dotfiles management across machines
- **Nix/NixOS**: Reproducible package management
- **Docker**: Containerized development environments

### Backup Solutions
- **Restic**: Encrypted, deduplicated backups
- **rclone**: Cloud storage synchronization
- **Git-based**: Version-controlled configuration tracking
- **Time Machine/rsync**: System-level backups

### Monitoring Tools
- **Prometheus/Grafana**: System monitoring dashboards
- **Cron/Systemd**: Scheduled backup automation
- **Healthchecks.io**: Backup job monitoring
- **Slack/Email**: Alert notifications

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Encrypted backups with strong keys
- Secure credential storage (1Password, Bitwarden)
- SSH key management and rotation
- Access control for backup repositories

### Network Security
- VPN configurations and certificates
- Firewall rules and network policies
- API key and token management
- Multi-factor authentication setup

## Testing Strategy

### Regular Validation
- Monthly recovery drills on test machines
- Automated backup integrity checks
- Configuration drift detection
- Performance benchmarking

### Disaster Scenarios
- Hardware failure simulation
- Complete disk corruption
- Network outage recovery
- Partial data loss scenarios

## Success Metrics

### Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)
- Emergency bootstrap: < 5 minutes
- Basic functionality: < 30 minutes
- Full productivity: < 2 hours

### Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- Configuration changes: < 1 hour
- Code repositories: < 15 minutes
- Active projects: < 30 minutes

## Future Enhancements
